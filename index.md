## Welcome to HS Batch 1969 Website

Ravenshaw Collegiate School was founded in  1851  by T. E. Ravenshaw, the education commission of British India at Orisa at that time.  Initially,  the College also operated from the same premise. A new building for the school came up in 1905 from where it is operating now. The school has a special name across India due to its famous alumni  Netaji Subhas Bose. Wikipedia mentions it as Subhas Bose's school.  The school has a history and a  place in India's freedom movements. The location of the school was a landmark at the time it was established, especially Cuttack being the seat of power for the British India when the state of Orissa   came into existence in 1936.  The school premise is located in an ideal settings near the bank of the river Kathjori (a tributary of the river Mahanadi). The buildings are iconic as are the class rooms with big windows. Unfortunately, the successive state governments have been apathetic to both secondary and primary education in the state. Hence, the school is really in bad shape.  It needs substantial infusion of funds both for the improvement of infrastructure and the running of day to day activities.
